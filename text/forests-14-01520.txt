Abstract: Ground ﬁltering is an essential step in airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR)
data processing in various applications. The cloth simulation ﬁltering (CSF) algorithm has gained
popularity because of its ease of use advantage. However, CSF has limitations in topographically
and environmentally complex areas. Therefore, an improved CSF (ICSF) algorithm was developed in
this study. ICSF uses morphological closing operations to initialize the cloth, and estimates the cloth
rigidness for providing a more accurate reference terrain in various terrain characteristics. Moreover,
terrain-adaptive height difference thresholds are developed for better ﬁltering of airborne LiDAR
point clouds. The performance of ICSF was assessed using International Society for Photogrammetry
and Remote Sensing urban and rural samples and Open Topography forested samples. Results
showed that ICSF can improve the ﬁltering accuracy of CSF in the samples with various terrain and
non-ground object characteristics, while maintaining the ease of use advantage of CSF. In urban and
rural samples, ICSF obtained an average total error of 4.03% and outperformed another eight reference
algorithms in terms of accuracy and robustness. In forested samples, ICSF produced more accuracy
than the well-known ﬁltering algorithms (including the maximum slope, progressive morphology,
and cloth simulation ﬁltering algorithms), and performed better with respect to the preservation of
steep slopes and discontinuities and vegetation removal. Thus, the proposed algorithm can be used
as an efﬁcient tool for LiDAR data processing.

1. Introduction

Airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) can quickly and accurately acquire three-
dimensional structural information of landscapes, and has been widely used in various
fields [1,2], e.g., terrain mapping [3–7], city modeling [8–12] and forestry inventory [13–17].
In almost all applications, ground ﬁltering, i.e., distinguishing ground points from non-
ground points, is a necessary step in LiDAR data processing [18–20]. For example, ground
ﬁltering is necessary to eliminate terrain effects in forestry application, such as tree species
classiﬁcation [14], tree height measurement [15] and biomass estimation [17]. Consequently,
different types of ﬁltering algorithms have been proposed in the past three decades. How-
ever, developing a ﬁltering algorithm that is effective and easy to use in various landscapes
still remains a challenge [21–27].
Existing filtering algorithms can be classified into three categories, i.e., slope-, morphology-
and surface-based methods [28–48]. Slope-based methods separate LiDAR point clouds

into ground and non-ground points, based on the assumption that the terrain slope changes
gradually in a neighborhood, while the changes between non-ground points (e.g., buildings
and vegetation points) and ground points are large. Morphology-based methods remove
non-ground points according to the height differences of the morphological surfaces before
and after opening operations. Surface-based methods gradually construct reference terrain
using an interpolation method (e.g., triangulated irregular network (TIN)), and then select
ground points based on the height differences between the points and the reference terrain.
Sithole and Vosselman [3] released a well-known benchmark dataset and compared the per-
formance of eight ﬁltering algorithms using the dataset. They concluded that surface-based
methods can achieve better results, because the methods use more context information than
other ﬁltering algorithms [3,41,46,49]. Among surface-based methods, the cloth simulation
ﬁltering (CSF) algorithm developed in recent years has received extensive attention and
application because of its ease of use and integration with several types of software, e.g.,
CloudCompare v2.11.3, Point Cloud Magic v2.0, and 3DF Zephyr v7.0 [27].
CSF simulates the physical process of cloth covering towards an inverted (upside-
down) point cloud to construct reference terrain, and then separates the point cloud into
ground points and non-ground points, based on the height differences between unclassiﬁed
points and the reference terrain. Speciﬁcally, a piece of horizontal cloth is placed above
an inverted point cloud. Then, the shape of the cloth is simulated by an external force
operation followed by an internal force operation. The external force operation is designed
to move the cloth towards the inverted point cloud. The internal force operation aims to
restrict the movement of the cloth to prevent the cloth from covering non-ground objects.
The process is performed iteratively until the shape of the cloth no longer changes, and
the cloth is considered as the reference terrain. Finally, ground points are extracted by
comparing the height differences between unclassiﬁed points and the reference terrain.
CSF is easy to use because users only need to set one enumeration parameter, i.e., cloth
rigidness. The cloth rigidness controls the strength of internal force, and is divided into
three categories: high, medium and low rigidness. These settings are usually applied to the
ﬂat terrain, slopes and raised terrain, respectively [2,13,27].
However, CSF also has limitations. First, it is difﬁcult for cloth to cover steep slopes,
where accurate reference terrain cannot be obtained to distinguish ground points from
non-ground points [26]. For example, cloth particle p still cannot collide with the point q on
steep slopes until the end of the simulation (Figure 1a). Second, a single cloth rigidness is
unreasonable, because multiple terrain features (i.e., ﬂat terrain, slopes and raised terrain)
are usually contained in a landscape (Figure 1b) [50]. Third, the points on rugged terrain
are often misclassiﬁed when using a ﬁxed height difference threshold, since terrain slopes
are not considered [26,50].
To solve these problems, Yang et al. [50] partitioned a point cloud into multiple
regions, where the richness of terrain features became lower relative to in the entire
scene, and thus the negative impact of cloth rigidness was reduced. In addition, the
reference terrain of steep slopes was constructed using a bidirectional cloth simulation
method. Finally, ground points were extracted based on adaptive height difference
thresholds, which were calculated using a weighted sum of the height differences of
unclassified points and their neighboring points. Wan et al. [51] proposed a terrain relief
index to automatically estimate the cloth rigidness applicable to a scene. These improved
algorithms improve the filtering accuracy of CSF, but sacrifice its ease of use, due to the
introduction of many additional parameters.

 

Figure 1. Limitations of CSF: (a) steep slopes cannot be covered by cloth; (b) a single cloth rigidness
is not suitable for the scene containing multiple terrain features, including ﬂat terrain, gentle slopes,
steep slopes and raised terrain.

Therefore, we aimed to develop a new improved CSF (ICSF) algorithm. The proposed
algorithm is expected to not only solve the three problems of CSF, but to also maintain its
ease of use advantage. Compared with the classical CSF algorithm, the main contributions
of ICSF are as follows:

(1)
The cloth is initialized by morphological closing operations. The initialized cloth can
cover steep slopes, where an accurate reference terrain can be obtained for ﬁltering
LiDAR point clouds.
(2)
Cloth rigidness can be set to low rigidness, since only the reference terrain of raised
terrain needs to be constructed after cloth initialization. This improves the adaptability
of the ﬁltering in the landscapes containing multiple terrain features.
(3)
Ground points and non-ground points are distinguished based on the terrain-adaptive
height difference thresholds with the consideration of terrain slopes. This can improve
ﬁltering accuracy on rugged terrain.

2. Methods

The ﬂowchart of ICSF is illustrated in Figure 2. First, the cloth is initialized using
morphological closing operations. Second, a reference terrain is estimated using cloth
simulation that does not require a cloth rigidness setting. Finally, ground points are
extracted using terrain-adaptive height difference thresholds.

 

Figure 2. Flowchart of ICSF. The upper and lower parts are the main steps of the proposed algorithm
and the results for each step for sample data.

2.1. Cloth Initialization

To overcome the limitation of cloth failing to cover steep slopes, we initialized the
cloth using morphological closing operations. The cloth is modeled as a grid that consists
of particles and springs based on the inverted point cloud. The particles are the center
points of the cells in the grid, and particle values are the elevations of the highest points in
the cells. The springs are established according to each particle and its eight neighboring
particles (Figure 3a). Then, the cloth is initialized by morphological closing operations.
The operation consists of a dilation operation DCloth(r, c) followed by an erosion operation
ECloth(r, c) (Figure 3b,c). The two operations replace the value of a particle to the maximum
and minimum values in a structuring element w, respectively [33,52]. They are expressed as:






DCloth(r, c) =
max
(r+u, c+v)∈w(Cloth (r + u, c + v))

ECloth(r, c) =
min
(r+u, c+v)∈w(Cloth (r + u, c + v))
(1)

where Cloth (r + u, c + v) is the value of a particle within w. Note that the results of dilation
operations are used as the inputs of erosion operations. The initialized cloth can cover not
only ﬂat terrain and gentle slopes, but also steep slopes (Figure 3c).

 

Figure 3. Main steps in cloth initialization: (a) cloth modeling. The cloth is modeled as a grid
consisting of particles and springs. The cloth values are the elevations of the highest points in the
grid cells, and the springs are constructed based on particles and their eight neighboring particles;
(b) dilation operation. The particle values are adjusted to the local maximum values; (c) erosion
operation. The particle values are adjusted to the local minimum values.

2.2. Reference Terrain Estimation

Only raised terrain in a landscape fails to be covered by cloth after initialization. The
reference terrain is constructed using the cloth simulation with low rigidness. The cloth
simulation consists of external force followed by internal force operations. Speciﬁcally, the
value of a particle after an external force operation is deﬁned in (2).

Cloth (r, c) =Cloth (r, c) −s
(2)

where s represents the descending distance, which is set to 0.5 m [15]. After the external
force operation, the collision detection between the particle and the point cloud is deﬁned
in (3).
δ = Cloth (r, c) −Point (r, c)
(3)

Forests 2023, 14, 1520
6 of 15

where δ represents the height difference between the cloth particle and the point cloud.
Point (r, c) is the height of the point cloud corresponding to the cloth particle. If δ is less
than 0, it means that the cloth particle collides with the point cloud. The value of the cloth
particle is adjusted by (4), and the property of the cloth particle is set to be unmovable.

Cloth (r, c) =Cloth (r, c) −δ
(4)

The value of a cloth particle after the internal force operation is determined by travers-
ing each spring of the particle. If the neighboring particle is unmovable, the value of the
cloth particle is calculated by (5).

where ri is cloth rigidness, which is set to low rigidness, as mentioned above, i.e., ri is
equal to 1. Otherwise, the cloth particle and the neighboring particle are moved in opposite
directions to the same height. Note that the results of external force operations are used
as the inputs of internal force operations. The simulation process is terminated if the
maximum height change of all particles is small enough. The cloth after the simulation
represents the reference terrain [27].

2.3. Ground Point Extraction

where a, b and c are the parameters of the ﬁtted plane (ax + by + cz + d = 0), which are
constructed based on each particle and its eight neighbors using a least-squares plane
ﬁtting method. Then, the height difference thresholds from an unclassiﬁed point to its nine
nearest-neighbor particles are calculated by the following equation:

Hi = ε + θ × ∆d
(7)

where Hi (i= 1, 2, . . . , 9) represents the height difference threshold corresponding to nine
particles. ∆d is the horizontal distance between the unclassiﬁed point and a particle. ε is
the height residual, which is set to 0.2 m [53]. Finally, if the height differences between
more than half of the particles and the unclassiﬁed point are less than the corresponding
thresholds, the unclassiﬁed point is marked as a ground point.

3. Experiment Design and Accuracy Assessment
3.1. Data

The benchmark dataset provided by International Society for Photogrammetry and
Remote Sensing (ISPRS) was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm.
The dataset was collected using the Optech Airborne Laser Terrain Mapping scanner in
seven sites, including four urban sites (named Sites 1–4) and three rural sites (named
Sites 5–7) [3]. As shown in Figure 4, non-ground objects with multiple types (e.g., buildings
and vegetation) and variable sizes are contained in urban sites; the terrain (e.g., steep slopes
and discontinuities) is the characteristic of rural sites. Details of each sample are listed in
Table 1. The reference data was manually generated using prior knowledge and available
airborne imagery.

 

Figure 4. Representative urban and rural samples: (a) Samp11; (b) Samp23; (c) Samp53. A large
amount of vegetation and many buildings are distributed on the hillside for S11. Large, irregularly
shaped buildings are characteristic of S23. In S53, there are many discontinuities and steep slopes on
the ground surface.

The samples with rugged terrain and dense vegetation are limited in the ISPRS dataset.
To comprehensively evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm in different
landscapes, we further tested the algorithm in four mountainous forested areas in the
Open Topography dataset. All samples are presented in Figure 5. As shown in Table 2, the
vegetation cover changes from 8.74% to 84.67%, and different terrain features (e.g., steep
slopes, ridges, and valleys) are included in the samples. The reference data of the samples
was generated by manual editing in CloudCompare software v2.11.3.

Figure 5. Forested samples: (a) S1; (b) S2; (c) S3; (d) S4. The four samples are characterized by
gentle slopes and dense vegetation, undulating terrain and dense vegetation, steep slopes and dense
vegetation, and steep slopes and discontinuities, respectively.

3.2. Parameter Setting

The structuring element size for initializing cloth is the only user-deﬁned parameter.
The threshold of the parameter should exceed the size of the largest object in a landscape
to prevent the initialized cloth from being covered on non-ground objects. The parameter
threshold in urban and rural samples was consistent with that in the literature [41], and
that of the forested samples was set to 10 m.

3.3. Comparative Algorithms

In addition to CSF, eight reference algorithms published by ISRPS were used as com-
parative algorithms for urban and rural samples. For forested samples, the proposed
algorithm was compared with the maximum slope ﬁltering (MSF), progressive morphology
ﬁltering (PMF) and CSF algorithms, which are classical algorithms of slope-, morphology-
and surface-based methods. MSF, PMF and CSF were implemented using the C++ pro-
gramming language and the PCL library.

3.4. Accuracy Measures

Type I error (TI), type II error (TII) and total error (TE) were used to quantitatively
assess the performance of the proposed algorithm. Type I error, type II error and total
error are the proportions of ground points misclassiﬁed as non-ground points in reference
ground points, non-ground points misclassiﬁed as ground points in reference non-ground
points, and misclassiﬁed points in all points [28]. They are calculated by the following
equations:

Forests 2023, 14, 1520

where a (b) is the number of ground (non-ground) points misclassiﬁed as non-ground
(ground) points, and c (d) is the number of reference ground (non-ground) points.

4. Results and Discussion
4.1. Urban and Rural Samples

The type I, type II and total errors of ICSF are listed in Table 3. ICSF achieved an
average total error of 4.03%. The total errors of ICSF did not exceed 5% in all samples
except Samps 11, 23 and 53. The total errors are 9.74%, 7.4% and 6.23% in the three samples,
respectively. In addition, the type II errors were large (>10%) in Samps 51, 52, 53 and 61.
This is because the number of non-ground points is small, and misclassiﬁcation of only a
few non-ground points will produce a large type II error [26].

Table 3. Type I, type II and total errors of ICSF in urban and rural samples (%).

Urban

Rural

To illustrate the reason why ICSF had relatively poor results in Samps 11, 23 and
53, we visualized the distribution of their type I and II errors (Figure 6). In Samp11, the
type I errors were mainly distributed on a fault scarp, as shown in the enlarged view A of
Figure 6a. The slope of the fault scarp is close to 90◦, which exhibits a similar character to
building facades. Due to the extreme slope, the cloth cannot collide sufﬁciently with the
fault scarp, resulting in the fault scarp not being covered by the cloth and thereby producing
ﬁltering errors. The type II errors were mainly distributed on the roof of a building, as
shown in the enlarged view B of Figure 6a. The building is located on a hillside, and the
height change between some parts of its roof and the hillside is not abrupt. This causes
the cloth to stick to the roof, and in turn results in the roof points being misclassiﬁed as
ground points [27]. In Samp23, the type I errors were distributed not only on a fault scarp,
as shown in the enlarged view A of Figure 6b, but also on a raised terrain, as shown in the
enlarged view B of Figure 6b. Unlike common raised terrain, the raised terrain has a large
height change compared to the surrounding terrain, which exhibits a similar character to
roofs of buildings. As a result, cloth cannot be collided with the raised terrain, generating
inaccurate reference terrain. The ground points on the raised terrain are misclassiﬁed as
non-ground points. The type II errors were mainly distributed on low non-ground objects,
where the cloth was directly pasted after an external force operation. This causes the points
on the low non-ground objects to be misclassiﬁed as ground points, due to inaccurate
reference terrain [27]. In Samp53, the type I and II errors were mainly distributed on fault
scarps and low non-ground objects, as shown in the enlarged views A and B of Figure 6c,
due to the same reasons as in Samps 11 and 23.

represented by TIN facets, since the vertical errors of LiDAR points may dominate the
shape of TIN facets. The limitation of PTDF can be overcome by the internal force operation
of ICSF.

4.2. Forested Samples

Table 6 exhibits the type I, type II and total errors of ICSF in all forested samples.
We can see that ICSF produced lower total errors in S1 and S2 compared to S3 and S4.
The ﬁrst two samples consist of gentle slopes and dense vegetation, while the latter two
samples have more complex terrain, including steep slopes and discontinuities. Overall,
ICSF obtained an average total error of 4.62%.

Figure 8. Total errors compared to other published algorithms in forested samples. ICSF showed
greater advantage in terms of accuracy, especially in complex terrain.

Figure 9 shows the digital terrain models (DTMs) of ICSF and classical ﬁltering
algorithms in all forested samples. PMF often misclassiﬁed vegetation points as ground
points in S1 (see the ellipse in the ﬁrst row of Figure 9b), because PMF considers an
unclassiﬁed point as a ground point as long as there is a ground point with a threshold less
than that of the unclassiﬁed point in a neighborhood [46]. On the contrary, ICSF identiﬁes
an unclassiﬁed point as a ground point when there are enough ground points around the
unclassiﬁed point. Thus, ICSF can reduce the errors that occur when non-ground points are
misjudged as ground points. PMF tended to misjudge ridge points as non-ground points
in S2, due to erosion operations (see the ellipse in the second row of Figure 9c) [18,38].
However, ICSF can estimate the raised terrain by external force operations, thus preserving
the ridge. In S3 and S4, PMF and CSF tended to smooth steep slopes (see the ellipses in the
last two rows of Figure 9c,d), while ICSF can effectively estimate steep slopes through cloth
initialization and external force operations, better preserving terrain details. Overall, ICSF

preservation of steep slopes and discontinuities and vegetation removal.

5. Conclusions

This study aimed to improve the CSF algorithm for various areas including urban,
rural and forested landscapes. Results showed that the ICSF algorithm outperformed the
well-known ﬁltering algorithms. The advantage of the ICSF algorithm lies within its ability
to more completely preserve steep slopes and discontinuities, while accurately ﬁltering out
non-ground points. Moreover, ICSF can be used as a useful tool to ﬁlter airborne LiDAR
data, due to its effectiveness, robustness and ease of use advantage. However, the proposed
algorithm also has the limitation that the ground points on fault scarps and the building
points on hillsides may be misclassiﬁed. This is essentially because these points violate
the underlying assumption that the height change of terrain is gradual, while the height
change between terrain and non-ground objects is abrupt. In the future, we will consider
combining image data to reduce such errors.
