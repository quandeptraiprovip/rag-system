Abstract

We present high quality image synthesis results using diffusion probabilistic models,
a class of latent variable models inspired by considerations from nonequilibrium
thermodynamics. Our best results are obtained by training on a weighted variational
bound designed according to a novel connection between diffusion probabilistic
models and denoising score matching with Langevin dynamics, and our models nat-
urally admit a progressive lossy decompression scheme that can be interpreted as a
generalization of autoregressive decoding. On the unconditional CIFAR10 dataset,
we obtain an Inception score of 9.46 and a state-of-the-art FID score of 3.17. On
256x256 LSUN, we obtain sample quality similar to ProgressiveGAN. Our imple-
mentation is available at https://github.com/hojonathanho/diffusion.

Introduction

Deep generative models of all kinds have recently exhibited high quality samples in a wide variety
of data modalities. Generative adversarial networks (GANs), autoregressive models, ﬂows, and
variational autoencoders (VAEs) have synthesized striking image and audio samples [14, 27, 3,
58, 38, 25, 10, 32, 44, 57, 26, 33, 45], and there have been remarkable advances in energy-based
modeling and score matching that have produced images comparable to those of GANs [11, 55].

34th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2020), Vancouver, Canada.

This paper presents progress in diffusion probabilistic models [53]. A diffusion probabilistic model
(which we will call a “diffusion model” for brevity) is a parameterized Markov chain trained using
variational inference to produce samples matching the data after ﬁnite time. Transitions of this chain
are learned to reverse a diffusion process, which is a Markov chain that gradually adds noise to the
data in the opposite direction of sampling until signal is destroyed. When the diffusion consists of
small amounts of Gaussian noise, it is sufﬁcient to set the sampling chain transitions to conditional
Gaussians too, allowing for a particularly simple neural network parameterization.

Diffusion models are straightforward to deﬁne and efﬁcient to train, but to the best of our knowledge,
there has been no demonstration that they are capable of generating high quality samples. We
show that diffusion models actually are capable of generating high quality samples, sometimes
better than the published results on other types of generative models (Section 4). In addition, we
show that a certain parameterization of diffusion models reveals an equivalence with denoising
score matching over multiple noise levels during training and with annealed Langevin dynamics
during sampling (Section 3.2) [55, 61]. We obtained our best sample quality results using this
parameterization (Section 4.2), so we consider this equivalence to be one of our primary contributions.

Despite their sample quality, our models do not have competitive log likelihoods compared to other
likelihood-based models (our models do, however, have log likelihoods better than the large estimates
annealed importance sampling has been reported to produce for energy based models and score
matching [11, 55]). We ﬁnd that the majority of our models’ lossless codelengths are consumed
to describe imperceptible image details (Section 4.3). We present a more reﬁned analysis of this
phenomenon in the language of lossy compression, and we show that the sampling procedure of
diffusion models is a type of progressive decoding that resembles autoregressive decoding along a bit
ordering that vastly generalizes what is normally possible with autoregressive models.

Background

Diffusion models [53] are latent variable models of the form pθ(x0) :=
R
pθ(x0:T ) dx1:T , where
x1, . . . , xT are latents of the same dimensionality as the data x0 ∼q(x0). The joint distribution
pθ(x0:T ) is called the reverse process, and it is deﬁned as a Markov chain with learned Gaussian
transitions starting at p(xT ) = N(xT ; 0, I):

pθ(x0:T ) := p(xT )

T
Y

t=1
pθ(xt−1|xt),
pθ(xt−1|xt) := N(xt−1; µθ(xt, t), Σθ(xt, t))
(1)

What distinguishes diffusion models from other types of latent variable models is that the approximate
posterior q(x1:T |x0), called the forward process or diffusion process, is ﬁxed to a Markov chain that
gradually adds Gaussian noise to the data according to a variance schedule β1, . . . , βT :

q(x1:T |x0) :=

T
Y

Training is performed by optimizing the usual variational bound on negative log likelihood:

E [−log pθ(x0)] ≤Eq

−log p(xT ) −

Efﬁcient training is therefore possible by optimizing random terms of L with stochastic gradient
descent. Further improvements come from variance reduction by rewriting L (3) as:

Eq

+
X


(5)

(See Appendix A for details. The labels on the terms are used in Section 3.) Equation (5) uses KL
divergence to directly compare pθ(xt−1|xt) against forward process posteriors, which are tractable
when conditioned on x0:

Consequently, all KL divergences in Eq. (5) are comparisons between Gaussians, so they can be
calculated in a Rao-Blackwellized fashion with closed form expressions instead of high variance
Monte Carlo estimates.

Diffusion models and denoising autoencoders

Diffusion models might appear to be a restricted class of latent variable models, but they allow a
large number of degrees of freedom in implementation. One must choose the variances βt of the
forward process and the model architecture and Gaussian distribution parameterization of the reverse
process. To guide our choices, we establish a new explicit connection between diffusion models
and denoising score matching (Section 3.2) that leads to a simpliﬁed, weighted variational bound
objective for diffusion models (Section 3.4). Ultimately, our model design is justiﬁed by simplicity
and empirical results (Section 4). Our discussion is categorized by the terms of Eq. (5).

3.1
Forward process and LT

We ignore the fact that the forward process variances βt are learnable by reparameterization and
instead ﬁx them to constants (see Section 4 for details). Thus, in our implementation, the approximate
posterior q has no learnable parameters, so LT is a constant during training and can be ignored.

3.2
Reverse process and L1:T −1

Second, to represent the mean µθ(xt, t), we propose a speciﬁc parameterization motivated by the
following analysis of Lt. With pθ(xt−1|xt) = N(xt−1; µθ(xt, t), σ2
t I), we can write:

Lt−1 = Eq

Lt−1 −C = Ex0,ϵ

1: xT ∼N(0, I)
2: for t = T, . . . , 1 do
3:
z ∼N(0, I) if t > 1, else z = 0

µθ(xt, t) = ˜µt

Ex0,ϵ

which resembles denoising score matching over multiple noise scales indexed by t [55]. As Eq. (12)
is equal to (one term of) the variational bound for the Langevin-like reverse process (11), we see
that optimizing an objective resembling denoising score matching is equivalent to using variational
inference to ﬁt the ﬁnite-time marginal of a sampling chain resembling Langevin dynamics.

To summarize, we can train the reverse process mean function approximator µθ to predict ˜µt, or by
modifying its parameterization, we can train it to predict ϵ. (There is also the possibility of predicting
x0, but we found this to lead to worse sample quality early in our experiments.) We have shown that
the ϵ-prediction parameterization both resembles Langevin dynamics and simpliﬁes the diffusion
model’s variational bound to an objective that resembles denoising score matching. Nonetheless,
it is just another parameterization of pθ(xt−1|xt), so we verify its effectiveness in Section 4 in an
ablation where we compare predicting ϵ against predicting ˜µt.

3.3
Data scaling, reverse process decoder, and L0

We assume that image data consists of integers in {0, 1, . . . , 255} scaled linearly to [−1, 1]. This
ensures that the neural network reverse process operates on consistently scaled inputs starting from
the standard normal prior p(xT ). To obtain discrete log likelihoods, we set the last term of the reverse
process to an independent discrete decoder derived from the Gaussian N(x0; µθ(x1, 1), σ2
1I):

pθ(x0|x1) =

D
Y

i=1

Z δ+(xi
0)

δ−(xi
0)
N(x; µi
θ(x1, 1), σ2
1) dx

(13)

where D is the data dimensionality and the i superscript indicates extraction of one coordinate.
(It would be straightforward to instead incorporate a more powerful decoder like a conditional
autoregressive model, but we leave that to future work.) Similar to the discretized continuous
distributions used in VAE decoders and autoregressive models [34, 52], our choice here ensures that
the variational bound is a lossless codelength of discrete data, without need of adding noise to the
data or incorporating the Jacobian of the scaling operation into the log likelihood. At the end of
sampling, we display µθ(x1, 1) noiselessly.

3.4
Simpliﬁed training objective

With the reverse process and decoder deﬁned above, the variational bound, consisting of terms derived
from Eqs. (12) and (13), is clearly differentiable with respect to θ and is ready to be employed for

4

training. However, we found it beneﬁcial to sample quality (and simpler to implement) to train on the
following variant of the variational bound:

where t is uniform between 1 and T. The t = 1 case corresponds to L0 with the integral in the
discrete decoder deﬁnition (13) approximated by the Gaussian probability density function times the
bin width, ignoring σ2
1 and edge effects. The t > 1 cases correspond to an unweighted version of
Eq. (12), analogous to the loss weighting used by the NCSN denoising score matching model [55].
(LT does not appear because the forward process variances βt are ﬁxed.) Algorithm 1 displays the
complete training procedure with this simpliﬁed objective.

Since our simpliﬁed objective (14) discards the weighting in Eq. (12), it is a weighted variational
bound that emphasizes different aspects of reconstruction compared to the standard variational
bound [18, 22]. In particular, our diffusion process setup in Section 4 causes the simpliﬁed objective
to down-weight loss terms corresponding to small t. These terms train the network to denoise data
with very small amounts of noise, so it is beneﬁcial to down-weight them so that the network can
focus on more difﬁcult denoising tasks at larger t terms. We will see in our experiments that this
reweighting leads to better sample quality.

4
Experiments

We set T = 1000 for all experiments so that the number of neural network evaluations needed
during sampling matches previous work [53, 55]. We set the forward process variances to constants
increasing linearly from β1 = 10−4 to βT = 0.02. These constants were chosen to be small
relative to data scaled to [−1, 1], ensuring that reverse and forward processes have approximately
the same functional form while keeping the signal-to-noise ratio at xT as small as possible (LT =
DKL(q(xT |x0) ∥N(0, I)) ≈10−5 bits per dimension in our experiments).

To represent the reverse process, we use a U-Net backbone similar to an unmasked PixelCNN++ [52,
48] with group normalization throughout [66]. Parameters are shared across time, which is speciﬁed
to the network using the Transformer sinusoidal position embedding [60]. We use self-attention at
the 16 × 16 feature map resolution [63, 60]. Details are in Appendix B.

4.1
Sample quality

Table 1 shows Inception scores, FID scores, and negative log likelihoods (lossless codelengths) on
CIFAR10. With our FID score of 3.17, our unconditional model achieves better sample quality than
most models in the literature, including class conditional models. Our FID score is computed with
respect to the training set, as is standard practice; when we compute it with respect to the test set, the
score is 5.24, which is still better than many of the training set FID scores in the literature.

We ﬁnd that training our models on the true variational bound yields better codelengths than training
on the simpliﬁed objective, as expected, but the latter yields the best sample quality. See Fig. 1 for
CIFAR10 and CelebA-HQ 256 × 256 samples, Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 for LSUN 256 × 256 samples [71],
and Appendix D for more.

4.2
Reverse process parameterization and training objective ablation

In Table 2, we show the sample quality effects of reverse process parameterizations and training
objectives (Section 3.2). We ﬁnd that the baseline option of predicting ˜µ works well only when
trained on the true variational bound instead of unweighted mean squared error, a simpliﬁed objective
akin to Eq. (14). We also see that learning reverse process variances (by incorporating a parameterized
diagonal Σθ(xt) into the variational bound) leads to unstable training and poorer sample quality
compared to ﬁxed variances. Predicting ϵ, as we proposed, performs approximately as well as
predicting ˜µ when trained on the variational bound with ﬁxed variances, but much better when trained
with our simpliﬁed objective.

4.3
Progressive coding

Table 1 also shows the codelengths of our CIFAR10 models. The gap between train and test is at
most 0.03 bits per dimension, which is comparable to the gaps reported with other likelihood-based
models and indicates that our diffusion model is not overﬁtting (see Appendix D for nearest neighbor
visualizations). Still, while our lossless codelengths are better than the large estimates reported for
energy based models and score matching using annealed importance sampling [11], they are not
competitive with other types of likelihood-based generative models [7].

Since our samples are nonetheless of high quality, we conclude that diffusion models have an inductive
bias that makes them excellent lossy compressors. Treating the variational bound terms L1 +· · ·+LT
as rate and L0 as distortion, our CIFAR10 model with the highest quality samples has a rate of 1.78
bits/dim and a distortion of 1.97 bits/dim, which amounts to a root mean squared error of 0.95 on a
scale from 0 to 255. More than half of the lossless codelength describes imperceptible distortions.

Progressive lossy compression
We can probe further into the rate-distortion behavior of our model
by introducing a progressive lossy code that mirrors the form of Eq. (5): see Algorithms 3 and 4,
which assume access to a procedure, such as minimal random coding [19, 20], that can transmit a
sample x ∼q(x) using approximately DKL(q(x) ∥p(x)) bits on average for any distributions p and
q, for which only p is available to the receiver beforehand. When applied to x0 ∼q(x0), Algorithms 3
and 4 transmit xT , . . . , x0 in sequence using a total expected codelength equal to Eq. (5). The receiver,

Progressive generation
We also run a progressive unconditional generation process given by
progressive decompression from random bits. In other words, we predict the result of the reverse
process, ˆx0, while sampling from the reverse process using Algorithm 2. Figures 6 and 10 show the
resulting sample quality of ˆx0 over the course of the reverse process. Large scale image features
appear ﬁrst and details appear last. Figure 7 shows stochastic predictions x0 ∼pθ(x0|xt) with xt
frozen for various t. When t is small, all but ﬁne details are preserved, and when t is large, only large
scale features are preserved. Perhaps these are hints of conceptual compression [18].

Connection to autoregressive decoding
Note that the variational bound (5) can be rewritten as:

(See Appendix A for a derivation.) Now consider setting the diffusion process length T to the
dimensionality of the data, deﬁning the forward process so that q(xt|x0) places all probability mass
on x0 with the ﬁrst t coordinates masked out (i.e. q(xt|xt−1) masks out the tth coordinate), setting

p(xT ) to place all mass on a blank image, and, for the sake of argument, taking pθ(xt−1|xt) to
be a fully expressive conditional distribution. With these choices, DKL(q(xT ) ∥p(xT )) = 0, and
minimizing DKL(q(xt−1|xt) ∥pθ(xt−1|xt)) trains pθ to copy coordinates t + 1, . . . , T unchanged
and to predict the tth coordinate given t + 1, . . . , T. Thus, training pθ with this particular diffusion is
training an autoregressive model.

We can therefore interpret the Gaussian diffusion model (2) as a kind of autoregressive model with
a generalized bit ordering that cannot be expressed by reordering data coordinates. Prior work has
shown that such reorderings introduce inductive biases that have an impact on sample quality [38],
so we speculate that the Gaussian diffusion serves a similar purpose, perhaps to greater effect since
Gaussian noise might be more natural to add to images compared to masking noise. Moreover, the
Gaussian diffusion length is not restricted to equal the data dimension; for instance, we use T = 1000,
which is less than the dimension of the 32 × 32 × 3 or 256 × 256 × 3 images in our experiments.
Gaussian diffusions can be made shorter for fast sampling or longer for model expressiveness.

4.4
Interpolation

We can interpolate source images x0, x′
0 ∼q(x0) in latent space using q as a stochastic encoder,
xt, x′
t ∼q(xt|x0), then decoding the linearly interpolated latent ¯xt = (1 −λ)x0 + λx′
0 into image
space by the reverse process, ¯x0 ∼p(x0|¯xt). In effect, we use the reverse process to remove
artifacts from linearly interpolating corrupted versions of the source images, as depicted in Fig. 8
(left). We ﬁxed the noise for different values of λ so xt and x′
t remain the same. Fig. 8 (right)
shows interpolations and reconstructions of original CelebA-HQ 256 × 256 images (t = 500). The
reverse process produces high-quality reconstructions, and plausible interpolations that smoothly
vary attributes such as pose, skin tone, hairstyle, expression and background, but not eyewear. Larger
t results in coarser and more varied interpolations, with novel samples at t = 1000 (Appendix Fig. 9).

Related Work

While diffusion models might resemble ﬂows [9, 46, 10, 32, 5, 16, 23] and VAEs [33, 47, 37],
diffusion models are designed so that q has no parameters and the top-level latent xT has nearly zero
mutual information with the data x0. Our ϵ-prediction reverse process parameterization establishes a
connection between diffusion models and denoising score matching over multiple noise levels with
annealed Langevin dynamics for sampling [55, 56]. Diffusion models, however, admit straightforward
log likelihood evaluation, and the training procedure explicitly trains the Langevin dynamics sampler
using variational inference (see Appendix C for details). The connection also has the reverse
implication that a certain weighted form of denoising score matching is the same as variational
inference to train a Langevin-like sampler. Other methods for learning transition operators of Markov
chains include infusion training [2], variational walkback [15], generative stochastic networks [1],
and others [50, 54, 36, 42, 35, 65].

By the known connection between score matching and energy-based modeling, our work could have
implications for other recent work on energy-based models [67–69, 12, 70, 13, 11, 41, 17, 8]. Our
rate-distortion curves are computed over time in one evaluation of the variational bound, reminiscent
of how rate-distortion curves can be computed over distortion penalties in one run of annealed
importance sampling [24]. Our progressive decoding argument can be seen in convolutional DRAW
and related models [18, 40] and may also lead to more general designs for subscale orderings or
sampling strategies for autoregressive models [38, 64].

Conclusion

We have presented high quality image samples using diffusion models, and we have found connections
among diffusion models and variational inference for training Markov chains, denoising score
matching and annealed Langevin dynamics (and energy-based models by extension), autoregressive
models, and progressive lossy compression. Since diffusion models seem to have excellent inductive
biases for image data, we look forward to investigating their utility in other data modalities and as
components in other types of generative models and machine learning systems.

Broader Impact

Our work on diffusion models takes on a similar scope as existing work on other types of deep
generative models, such as efforts to improve the sample quality of GANs, ﬂows, autoregressive
models, and so forth. Our paper represents progress in making diffusion models a generally useful
tool in this family of techniques, so it may serve to amplify any impacts that generative models have
had (and will have) on the broader world.

Unfortunately, there are numerous well-known malicious uses of generative models. Sample gen-
eration techniques can be employed to produce fake images and videos of high proﬁle ﬁgures for
political purposes. While fake images were manually created long before software tools were avail-
able, generative models such as ours make the process easier. Fortunately, CNN-generated images
currently have subtle ﬂaws that allow detection [62], but improvements in generative models may
make this more difﬁcult. Generative models also reﬂect the biases in the datasets on which they
are trained. As many large datasets are collected from the internet by automated systems, it can be
difﬁcult to remove these biases, especially when the images are unlabeled. If samples from generative
models trained on these datasets proliferate throughout the internet, then these biases will only be
reinforced further.

On the other hand, diffusion models may be useful for data compression, which, as data becomes
higher resolution and as global internet trafﬁc increases, might be crucial to ensure accessibility of
the internet to wide audiences. Our work might contribute to representation learning on unlabeled
raw data for a large range of downstream tasks, from image classiﬁcation to reinforcement learning,
and diffusion models might also become viable for creative uses in art, photography, and music.
